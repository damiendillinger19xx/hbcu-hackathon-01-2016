Online bank for non-muggles

Implementation of cash transfer (square cash like app) between people 
using API provided by Capital One.

Online bank for non-muggles. Built during the HBCU hackathon, uses Capital One's the then new api called Nessie. To use, clone/fork the project and run using normal django commands. If you have an account at Capital One you can actually pay your friends with a Capital One account using this web application.
